GPT - 3.5 was no longer a completion model
Previous chat messages are fed back into the prompt giving it a memory that is limited by context length.
Theres a prompt before your prompt that tells the AI what it's meant to do before it responds to you. 
- You're an LLM, date, biases etc

An autonomous system that can interpret instructions, make decisions, and perform tasks—often by chaining together multiple actions or tools.
Github Copilot runs the loop andgives access to tools, it gets info from your machine Ie files, info abut various things, the tab you're on
it then runs a language model and loop it until it decides to give an answer? (check audio, 20:00)

Anthropic announced they disrupted the first reported AI - Orchestrated cyber espionage campaign
- Data was taken in ~3 cases
- Governments are involved

### Limitations of Coding Agents
- Easy to use, difficult to use well.
- Context length
- – currently for large codebases, they often don’t have sight of all the code.
- They are currently not very tidy and will often leave dead code around.
- They are currently trained on ~6-month-old data and sometimes won’t know much about specialised/new codebases.
- Huge security concerns
- They can run any command if you let them! Which can be catastrophic …

### Tips for using LLM coding agents
- It is essential to use version control / git. I will save a lot of time.
- - Commit whatever you are happy with when it's done, so you don't end up with AI Fucking up and ruining the code, making it unusable
- Use new chats for implementing new features/working on different parts of the code.
- - If you keep on the same chat and change topcs/ when the previous responses aren't related to the next thing you're saying, use a new chat
  - The internal prompts are still there. It'll mess shit up
- Learn when to be explicit or general in your request. |-> Vibe coding 
- - You don't want to bias its' response by giving too much info
  - - I really like this thing, make it better |-> It'll try to please it
  - Too general and you're not getting it the relevant stuff
- <mark> Keep an eye on your request usage! </mark> 
- - There is a button in the bottom right of vscode to do this: 
- A coding agent is currently still a tool and you are still responsible for the code you get from it, and how you fill your time when waiting for the agent to finish …
